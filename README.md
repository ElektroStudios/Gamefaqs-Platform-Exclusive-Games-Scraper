Your contribution is highly appreciated!. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or encounter issues, feel free to open an issue. Your input helps make this Work better for everyone. Thank you for your support! üöÄ

Requesting the addition of new tables for other platforms is allowed, but such platform must exist on the Gamefaqs website.

The game entries of the tables are limited by the game entries that exist on the Gamefaqs website. This means that if you notice that an exclusive or multi-platform game is missing for a platform, it is possible that the game is cancelled, has not yet been released, or there is no entry on the Gamefaqs website. Please check if that is the case before creating an issue.
